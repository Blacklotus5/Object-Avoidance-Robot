# ü§ñ Object Avoidance Robot

An **autonomous robot car** built using Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, and a motor driver module to detect and avoid obstacles in its path. This project demonstrates the use of **sensors, actuators, and control logic** in robotics.

## üìå Features
- Uses **ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** to detect obstacles.  
- Avoids collisions by **stopping and turning** when an obstacle is detected.  
- Controlled via **Arduino UNO**.  
- **DC motors + L298N motor driver** for movement.  
- Powered by **2 √ó 3.7V Li-ion batteries** connected in series.  
- Compact design for robotics projects and DIY learning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Components Required
- 1 √ó Arduino UNO  
- 1 √ó L298N Motor Driver Board  
- 2 √ó DC Geared Motors (left & right wheels)  
- 1 √ó Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- 1 √ó Servo Motor (to rotate ultrasonic sensor)  
- 2 √ó 3.7V Li-ion batteries (connected in series for ~7.4V)  
- Connecting wires, chassis, wheels, and switch

## üîß How It Works
1. **Ultrasonic Sensor** continuously scans the front using the servo motor.  
2. If the distance is **greater than a safe threshold (e.g., 20cm)** ‚Üí Robot moves forward.  
3. If an **obstacle is detected** ‚Üí  
   - Robot stops.  
   - Scans left & right directions using the servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor.  
   - Turns in the direction with more free space.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Arduino IDE
- Download from [Arduino official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the Code
- Open `obs_avd.ino` in Arduino IDE.  
- Select **Board: Arduino UNO**.  
- Select the correct **COM port**.  
- Click **Upload**.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Assemble the Circuit
- Follow the wiring in `object_avoidance_bb.png`.  
- Place robot on flat surface.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Robot
- Switch on the power supply (2 √ó 3.7V LiPo in series).  
- Robot will now move forward and avoid obstacles autonomously.

## üìú Code Explanation
Key parts of the Arduino sketch (`obs_avd.ino`):  

- **Motor control**: Forward, backward, left, right, stop functions using L298N.  
- **Ultrasonic distance measurement**: `pulseIn()` used to measure echo return time.  
- **Servo scanning**: Rotates ultrasonic sensor to left and right.  
- **Decision making**: Based on distance values, robot decides where to turn.

## üß© Possible Improvements
- Add **IR sensors** for edge detection.  
- Use **PID control** for smoother turns.  
- Upgrade power system for longer runtime.  
- Add **Bluetooth/WiFi control** for manual override.  
- Use **Li-ion 18650 cells** for better battery life.
